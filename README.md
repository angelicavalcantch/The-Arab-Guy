# The-Arab-Guy and my first Commit


Hello, everyone!

This exercise is part of my first steps using HTML5/CSS3;

Thanks to the group Elas Unidas I am practicing how to create a website/blog.

The starting point was based on the exercise from https://github.com/radharay/ElasUnidas-Porfolio.

I still wonder how to improve in terms of layouts and responsiveness; if possible I would like some feedback about those topics.

About TAG: Abdul is a dear friend of mine who lives in Saudi Arabia. He kindly let me use his photos from his trips and day-to-day life - in Riyadh and Dammam - in order to create a website for him. 

Visit his Instagram and also get inspired:
